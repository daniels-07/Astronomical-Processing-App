This program generates 24 random data entries and fills an array with them. The program allows the user to sort, edit, and search the data. 

Note that the search function requires the data to be sorted in order to function, if the data has not yet been sorted it will automatically sort the data for you. 

To use edit mode you must enter the index of the entry you wish to edit and then enter the number you want to edit it over.
